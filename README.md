# Call-by-Push-Value-COMP523-
This repository is for a COMP523 (Language-Based Security) final project where we explore Call-by-Push-Value (https://pblevy.github.io/papers/thesisqmwphd.pdf) operational and static semantics and implement a typechecker and evaluator for CBPV programs along with a translator for CBN programs into CBPV programs.
